# Mechanical keyboard

## Summary

So I'm planning to build a mechanical keyboard, ordering all the parts and then assembling it myself! I'm mostly going to be using this for school projects and such 
but also for gaming, so It's in my best interest to make one with has a fast response time, which most mechanical keyboards do but also silent in order to not disturb 
my parents or siblings. I saw a youtube tutorial about building a keyboard and I reckon that it I would be able to build it given enough time as It doesn't seem too
difficult but does seem like a challenge nonetheless. I have also needed a keyboard as I built my own PC a few weeks ago and have been using a half broken membrane keyboard
which doesnt really seem to be working properly anymore.

## Plan
I'll order a hot-swappable PCB, case and keycaps in order to build it. I decided against using a PCB which would require a soldering iron as I doubt I have the skills
in order to properly build one requiring that, plus it would also be quite a challenge to obtain a soldering iron kit as they are not very easy to get. I'm using a 
tutorial on youtube to guide me while building as this is my first time, and also google in case I run into any problems. Its going to be using a USB-C cable which I can
get quite easily aswell so it shouldnt be too much of a challenge.
